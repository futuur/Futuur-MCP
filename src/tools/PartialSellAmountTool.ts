    Simulate and calculate the amount you would receive for partially selling a specified number of shares in a bet, without executing the sale.

    Common use cases:
    - When the user wants to know how much they would receive for selling part of their bet.
    - When planning a partial sale before actually executing it.
    - When the user asks "If I sell 10 shares of my bet, how much will I get?"

    Warning: This tool only simulates the amount you would receive; it does not execute the sale.
    Warning: Both the bet ID and the number of shares to sell must be specified.
    Warning: Use the actual sell tool to execute a sale after reviewing the simulation.
